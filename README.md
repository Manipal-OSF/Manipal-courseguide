# Manipal-courseguide

Hey everyone, Shichi here. Thanks for checking out OSF. It's still a major work in progress project. So don't expect much at the start coming into it. But we will be adding self-made text based notes, videos and basically everything that we can find here. 

If you have any resources or want to help us out in the project then come to discord or make pull requests here. 

Contact either me, Karthik (KPBAN), Deep (Deepchan) or Lance (Rudeus) on discord so that we can talk on how to make this project even better. 

That's all. Thank you folks. Hope this helps you out.
